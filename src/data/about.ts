    Welcome to my world! 🌍 Chill here and get to know me a bit.
</p>
<p>
    Hey there! 👋 I'm Rajul —a Frontend Web and Mobile Developer who loves sipping coffee while coding ☕💻. My main skills lie in using React (with Vite and Next.js) and Angular for the web, and Flutter for mobile. On the backend side, I'm comfortable with Express and I've dipped my toes into Laravel as well. My go-to databases are Firebase, SQL, and PouchDB.
</p>
<p>
    I love exploring new things and trying out different technologies. I'm a big believer that fundamentals — like problem-solving and logical thinking — matter more than any framework. Once you get those right, you can learn whatever comes up in the future! 🚀
</p>
<p> 
    I'm quite comfortable with development methods like Agile, Waterfall, and Scrum, and I like to blend in concepts from Human-Centered Design and Human-Computer Interaction. That way, I can make sure the apps I build aren’t just functional, but also convenient and enjoyable for people to use.
</p>
<p>
    Communication is key in any team — it's something I really value and try to bring into all my collaborations. 🙌
</p>
<p>
    Besides coding, I have experience leading a team. Back in college, I led a small team to develop an Android app with Flutter, and I also led a student organization to execute programs and initiatives. My portfolio reflects not only my technical skills but also my ability to collaborate, solve problems, and grow together with a team.
</p>
<p>
    Excited about the chance to collaborate with you!
</p>
